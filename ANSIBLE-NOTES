 In the past, system administrators had to manually handle updates, security patches, and software installations across many servers using custom scripts, which became more challenging as the number of servers increased. 
To simplify this process, tools like Puppet, Chef, and Ansible were developed. Ansible, unlike some other tools, does not require an agent to be installed on the managed servers and communicates over SSH,
using a language called YAML to define configurations and automate tasks in a human-readable format. 
This makes Ansible a popular choice for managing large-scale infrastructure in a consistent and automated way. 
It supports various operating systems including Linux, Windows, and AIX, and can dynamically gather information about your infrastructure from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud.  


WHY ANSIBLE:
             Ansible is a popular choice for managing large-scale infrastructure for several reasons:

1. **Simplicity**: Ansible uses YAML, a human-readable language, to define configurations and automation tasks, making it approachable for teams without deep programming knowledge.

2. **Agentless**: Unlike some other tools, Ansible does not require a separate agent to be installed on the managed servers, simplifying the setup and maintenance process.

3. **Communication**: Ansible communicates with managed servers over SSH, typically using passwordless authentication, and it supports various operating systems including Linux, Windows, and AIX.

4. **Dynamic Inventory**: Ansible can automatically gather details about your infrastructure from cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud, reducing the need for manual updates to the inventory file.

5. **Community and Ecosystem**: Ansible has a strong community and a rich ecosystem of modules and playbooks that can be easily shared and reused, saving time and effort in configuration management and automation.
